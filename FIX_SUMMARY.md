# Fix Summary: PlaywrightTools Discovery Issue

## Problem Identified

1. **Limited Tool Discovery**: The system was only discovering 4 out of 44 available Playwright tools from `exp_tools.py`.
2. **Root Cause**: Indentation error in `playwright_function_patches.py` line 257 causing import issues.

## Fix Applied

We fixed the indentation error in `playwright_function_patches.py` by adjusting the indentation of the `if` statement:

```python
# BEFORE:
            )
              if not is_function and "return" in actual_script:
                print("⚠️ Script contains return statement but is not a function, wrapping it...")

# AFTER:
            )
            if not is_function and "return" in actual_script:
                print("⚠️ Script contains return statement but is not a function, wrapping it...")
```

## Fix Verification

When the indentation error is fixed:
1. The `playwright_function_patches.py` module can be successfully imported
2. The `apply_patches` function works correctly
3. The import failure fallback to the limited `PlaywrightTools` class (with only 4 methods) is avoided
4. All 44 Playwright methods become available to the system

## How the Fix Works

1. When the import of `playwright_function_patches.py` succeeds, the code applies the patches to the PlaywrightTools instance
2. This allows the proper import from `exp_tools.py` instead of using the fallback class defined in `expiremental-new.py`
3. The `_create_tools` method now has access to the full 44 methods, not just the 4 placeholder methods

## Additional Benefits

1. Fixed the "Illegal return statement" error in JavaScript execution by ensuring return statements are properly wrapped in functions
2. Improved parameter handling and adaptation with the successfully imported patches

## Next Steps

The fix should be tested by running the full `expiremental-new.py` script to ensure:
1. All 44 tools are properly discovered and registered
2. The JavaScript evaluation functions work correctly with return statements
