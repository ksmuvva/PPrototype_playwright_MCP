To fix the tool discovery issue in PlaywrightMCPServer._create_tools method:

1. Change this line:
   tool_methods = [name for name in dir(self.tools_instance) 
                  if callable(getattr(self.tools_instance, name)) 
                  and not name.startswith('_')]

   To this:
   tool_methods = [name for name in dir(self.tools_instance) 
                  if callable(getattr(self.tools_instance, name)) 
                  and name.startswith('playwright_')]

2. Remove this check inside the loop:
   if method_name.startswith("playwright_"):
   
   Since we're already filtering for playwright_ methods in the list comprehension.

This fix ensures that:
- We're directly looking for methods that start with 'playwright_' instead of just filtering out those with '_'
- We'll find all available tools in the PlaywrightTools class
- The output will show all available tools, not just a subset

You can apply this fix by editing the `expiremental-new.py` file.
